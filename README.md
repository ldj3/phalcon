Phalcon-PHP is a free replacement for the [Phalcon Web Framework](https://github.com/phalcon/cphalcon), delivered as a set of PHP classes based on the [Phalcon Devtools](https://github.com/phalcon/phalcon-devtools). This project allows the usage of the Phalcon API in environments without the possibility to set up the phalcon extension (e.g. shared hosting) by providing a compatibility layer.

## Disclaimer
1. This project is in the **pre-alpha** stadium and is currently not maintained. **Do not** use this in a production environment.
2. This project currently only refers to the cphalcon version 1.2.6, which is **outdated**.
3. The codebase is **very unstable** and **incomplete** *(VOLT, PHQL, ...)*. A large number of PHPUnit tests fails and the code coverage is even worse.
4. The code **contains bugs**, which are "copied" from the C sources of cphalcon.
5. The entire project is currently **not maintained**. If you want to fix some of the issues, feel free to do so - I will merge your pull requests.
6. The cphalcon framework API itself frequently contradicts my own development patterns and the biggest part of the code structure is also not my own work. Don't judge me.

## Current tasks
  * Volt Parser (Scanner + Tokenizer)
  * PHQL Parser (Scanner + Tokenizer)
  * Unit Tests
  * Documentation (Wiki)

## Development
The current project **is not usable for any purpose** and still requires a lot of implementation. As the base for all developments, this project is using the `phalcon-devtools/ide/1.2.6` tree as a starting point.
In case you are interested in contributing, please note that - except of the original Phalcon files - the entire code should follow the [PSR-1](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md) and [PSR-2](http://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-2/) coding standards. The entire code should be additionally documented by PHPDoc annotations.

## Documentation
It is possible to generate a low-level PHPDoc-based documentation of the entire code by using [PHP_UML](https://pear.php.net/manual/en/package.php.php-uml.command-line.php) or [phpDocumentator](http://www.phpdoc.org/). The repository contains a shell script, which generates the corresponding documentation if one or both of the tools are available.

## Branching
Although the cphalcon project uses branches to manage releases, this project uses tags.
After the first release the development version can be found in the `dev` branch and the stable 
version is `master`. We suggest the usage of feature branches if you want to submit something.

## License
To keep the compatibility with the framework, this legacy layer is licensed under the terms of the New BSD license.

## Usage
You can use this project as a fallback for the original framework. Add this to your composer.json:

```
	"require": {
		"scento/phalcon-php": "dev-master"
	}
```
